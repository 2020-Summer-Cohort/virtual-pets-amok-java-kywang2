# Virtual Pet Shelter

Think of your fondest childhood memories and you may immediately think of how much fun you had when you played with your tamagotchi and digimon. What if I was to say you could continue playing with a virtual pet...even now as an adult!?

Introducing the newest interactive game where you get to hang out and play with virtual cats and dogs like your favorite virtual buddy, Kyle the Cat but now, you have the option to hang with robotic cats and dogs such as Ricky the Robotic Dog and Ronnie the Robotic Cat as we've created a whole shelter of virtual cats and dogs and virtual robotic cats and dogs.  Watch as you can feed, give water, play, walk, clean the cage of either one or your whole squad of favorite virtual pals.  Additionally, since they're a part of a whole virtual animal shelter, you have the opportunity to adopt one animal and even admit one of your own if they grow too much for you to care for.  Make sure you take good care of each animal and are constantly looking out for their vital bodily functions as with each turn, each animal's overall health level increase and if it reaches level 15, they take off and escape from the shelter!

The programming behind this application is that each cat, dog, robotic cat, and robotic dog is an animal in the virtual animal shelter is a part of an ArrayList that comprises of their name, their description, and random levels for their 3 major bodily functions: boredom, tiredness, overall health, in addition for natural pets, hunger, thirst, waste, and cage cleanliness and for robots oil level.  The natural animals have a natural interface that activates functions only relevant to them such as cleaning the cage, feeding, and giving them water while robotic animals have a robotic interface that activates functions only relevant to them such as oiling. You give a user input for each of the 9 activities: feeding the natural pets, giving the natural pets water, playing with them, letting them sleep, giving the robotic animals oil, walking the pets, cleaning the cage of the natural pets as well as adopting an animal or admitting an animal of your own.  Each activity will affect that respective pet's level of overall health and if you chose to adopt, it'll remove one of the animals from the ArrayList.  If you choose to admit an animal, you have to enter in their name as well as description and they'll be added to the ArrayList and be included in the animal shelter.  With each turn, each overall health level will automatically increase 1 level and if the level reaches 15, the game is over.

Play with Kyle the Cat or any of his fun pals and let one of them be your new favorite roommate! Who says you're too old to have virtual pets?
